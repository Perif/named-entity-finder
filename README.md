# named-entity

A Clojure library for named entity extraction.

*IN PROGRESS*

```clojure

(clarity-extract "Call John Doe from London on Wednesday 6pm")

{:entities [
  {:token "date", :value "Wednesday"}
  {:token "location", :value "London"}],
 :action "Call John Doe from London on Wednesday 6pm",
 :when "2015-03-18T18:00:00.000Z"}

```

## Usage

```clojure
(ns my-ns
  (:require [named-entity.core :refer [extract-entities ?e]]))

;; Extract entities of a given type (person, location, date or time)

(extract-entities :person "I spoke to Jack Dorsey at the weekend")
;; [{:token "person", :value "Jack Dorsey"}]

;; Extract all entities (slower)

(extract-entities "Working with David in London Tomorrow afternoon at 6pm")

;; {:token "person", :value "David"}
;; {:token "date", :value "Tomorrow"}
;; {:token "time", :value "afternoon"}
;; {:token "location", :value "London"})

```
