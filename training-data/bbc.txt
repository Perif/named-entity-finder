Pressures in England's A&E units have hit record levels, with the lowest percentage of patients seen within four hours since monitoring began in 2010.

Data showed just under 90% of patients were seen within four hours in the seven days up to December 14.

Major units particularly struggled, with just six out of 140 meeting the target to see 95% within four hours.

Performance in Wales and Northern Ireland is even worse, while the picture in Scotland is unclear.

Just over 440,000 patients visited A&E in the week ending 14 December with 89.8% seen within four hours.

As well as posting the worst performance against the four-hour target, other measures also show the service is under strain.

There were over 111,000 emergency admissions to hospital - 80,000 from A&E units - which is an all-time high.

Trolley waits - that is waits of four hours or more for a bed once a decision to admit a patient into hospital from A&E is made - topped 10,000 for the first time.

That compares to under 4,000 for the same week last year.

Delays getting patients out of hospital once they are ready for discharge are also much higher than average.

Megan Hill, from London, told the BBC about the contrasting experiences of both her grandmothers who fell and broke their hips within days of each other.

"Two London paramedics were forced to sit with my grandmother on a trolley for over eight hours, waiting for an available bed. The first time she was offered food was 01:00 on Wednesday morning - she fell on Tuesday morning.

"In a horrible coincidence, my other 86-year-old grandmother also fell and broke her hip just 48 hours earlier.

"She was picked up immediately by North Wales paramedics, seen and admitted the moment she arrived. Suffice to say she was also offered food.

"The level of patient care should not be postcode dependent."
